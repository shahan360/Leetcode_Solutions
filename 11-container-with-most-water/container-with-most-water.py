        # Brute Force Approach
        '''
        Time Complexity : O(n^2) because we are using two nested loops to calculate the area.
        Space Complexity : O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space.
        Intuition:
        - We will use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array.
        - We will calculate the area between the two pointers and move the pointer with the smaller height towards the other pointer.
        - We keep updating the maximum area found so far.
