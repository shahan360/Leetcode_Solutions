class Logger: # humne Logger class banaya hai jo messages ko track karega (we created a Logger class to track messages)
    '''
    Intuition:
    We need to keep track of the last time each message was printed. If a message is
    printed again within 10 seconds of its last print, we should not print it again and return False.
    If a message is printed for the first time, we should print it and return True.
    For this, we can use a dictionary to map messages to their last printed timestamp.
    We can also use a set to keep track of all messages that have been printed at least once.
