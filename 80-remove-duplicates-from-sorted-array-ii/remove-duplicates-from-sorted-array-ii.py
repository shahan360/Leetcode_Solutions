        • We track how many times each number appears using a map.
        • If a number appears ≤ k times, we add it to a result list.
        • Then we copy that list back to the original array.

        • We use two pointers: one (fast) to scan and one (slow) to overwrite allowed elements.
        • We count duplicates and only allow each element to appear at most twice.
        • If count is within limit, we place it in the right position using the slow pointer.

        • Start slow and fast from index k since first k elements are always allowed.
        • Only copy current fast element to slow if it's different from the element k places behind.
        • This ensures each number appears at most k times in the result.
