        We will add pairs to this set as we find them.
        This set will help us to ensure that we only count unique pairs.
        The pairs will be stored as tuples (min, max) to ensure uniqueness.
        For example, if we find the pair (1, 3), we will store it as (1, 3) and not (3, 1).

#     sol = Solution()
#     nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]

#     result = sol.findPairs(nums, k)

# The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array,
# because we are iterating through the array once and using a set to store the seen elements
# and the pairs, which allows for O(1) average time complexity for lookups and insertions.
# The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, if all elements are unique,
# because we are storing all elements in the seen set and potentially all pairs in the pairs set.

# # Visualization of pairs:
# # For nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and k = 2:
# # Seen set will be built as follows:
# # After processing 3: seen = {3}
# # After processing 1: seen = {1, 3}
# # After processing 4: seen = {1, 3, 4}
# # After processing 1: seen = {1, 3, 4} (1 is already in seen)
# # After processing 5: seen = {1, 3, 4, 5}
# # Pairs set will be built as follows:
# # After processing 3: pairs = {}
# # After processing 1: pairs = {}
# # After processing 4: pairs = {(1, 3)}
# # After processing 1: pairs = {(1, 3)} (1 is already in pairs)
# # After processing 5: pairs = {(1, 3), (3, 5)}
# # Final pairs set = {(1, 3), (3, 5)}
# # The length of pairs set is 2, which is the final result.
